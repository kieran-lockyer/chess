# Chess

This is a personal project to hone my coding skills. Built in react, it's a chess app that I plan to build with fully fledged online capabilities, real-time multiplayer, game lobbies, tournaments, and maybe an engine if I still feel ambitious.

Features:
- Classical untimed chess, over the board (Complete)
- Timed chess, over the board (coming soon)
- Online Multiplayer (coming soon)
- Other variations of chess - antichess, chess960 etc. (coming soon)
- Chess Engine (way off in the distance)
